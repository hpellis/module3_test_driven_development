# CHAPTER 3 - INTRODUCTION TO TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#test-driven development is the process of implementing code by writing tests first and then writing code that passes the tests
#TDD is a cycle of writing tests, followed by coding and repeating
#the code goes through many iterations of tests, writing and development
#testing ensures correctness under a basic set of conditions
#syntax errors will almost certaily be caught by running tests
#it is not about proving the code is correct under any set of conditions, rather aiming for a reasonably complete set of possible conditions
#testing requires you to consider how the code will function in unusual conditions, and may reveal logical errors in the code

#testing is helpful when refactoring, or updating code
#unit testing ensures that changes to your code don't break other components

#code designed with testing in mind is generally modular, as this enables testing

###implementing TDD
#1. write a test
#2. write the minimum code to pass the test
#3. write another test
#4. adapt and extend current code
#5. repeat until you can write no more tests

#repeat this process for every feature

#rule 1: the goal of the code you write is to pass the test
#rule 2: you only write the code you need to make that one test pass
